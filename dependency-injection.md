# Demystifying Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is commonly recommended as a best practice. This is forced upon developers by libraries and frameworks with no real explanation of why it’s necessary. In this talk we will discuss what dependency injection is, why it’s important, and how it works. We will follow this with a demo of wiring up our own composition root with basic C# and comparing that with how DI containers are configured. The goal of this talk is to demystify the magic of DI containers.
