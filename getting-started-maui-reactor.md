# Introducing MauiReactor: .NET MAUI applications with superpowers

.NET MAUI is the latest unified UI framework from Microsoft that let you build applications for Mobile and Desktop from a single code base. 
MauiReactor is a library that allows you to write applications on top of .NET MAUI much faster and easier thanks to the MVU design pattern and a first-class hot-reload tool.
If you are asking what MVU is, well, is pretty much the same UI paradigm adopted by frameworks like ReactJS/ReactNative, Flutter, and SwiftUI!

In this talk, we'll see how to create a complete MauiReactor application, starting from the environment setup, through the creation of components and pages much of the time without even restarting the app!
Apart from basic concepts, I'll introduce you to Animations and Graphics controls and we'll dig into performance considerations and specific tasks that can bring your app to the next level.

## Outline

* MVVM vs MVU
* Setting up the project
* Familiarizing with Components
* Hot-reload Mode (Simple vs Full)
* Stateless vs Stateful Components
* Navigations with Props
* Animations
* Drawing controls
* Performance considerations and advanced scenarios
