### Putting Code Where it Belongs:

Code organization is an opinonated endeavor that's easily overlooked - it's easy to focus purely on _what_ to write instead of _where_ it'll be written.
Proper, consistent code placement enables you to enjoy refactoring by minimizing the chances of inadvertently accessing wrong code; and there's more to it than a rigid file structure. Using some of the newest language features, we can work on separating our data, logic, persistency, and display elements so that we our code can be concise, focused, and readable. 
This talk will go over some of my own approaches and guidelines to code separation mimicking real-world examples that can be broadly applied to many projects, though with a focus on a typical ASP.NET Core setup.
