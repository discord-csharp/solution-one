# Filter, Sort, and Transform ObservableCollections with DynamicData

For many desktop and mobile applications, the ObservableCollection is an essential part for displaying lists and data that change over time. But when your app grows more complex and you need to filter or sort those collections, modifying the ObservableCollection directly becomes difficult and prone to errors.

Building on top of [Reactive Extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive), this talk introduces the [DynamicData](https://github.com/reactivemarbles/DynamicData/) library that makes writing these filters and sorts more concise. During the talk, we will give a short primer on Reactive Extensions and show how to incorporate DynamicData in a WPF project.
