# Developing and Deploying Static Web Apps with Blazor and Azure Functions

Blazor brings C# to the browser. Azure Functions lets your back-end scale. But how do you get started creating an Azure Static Web App using these two and how do you implement a rock-solid CI/CD pipeline for it?

We will walk through the whole process! Starting from writing and debugging your Blazor app and Functions API, we will also unit test our front and back-end and glue them together with the authentication service emulator for local development. For CI/CD and service management needs, like staging environments and user invitations, we will conclude with a scalable build pipeline that can be flexibly reused for your future projects!

Come to this talk when you want to improve your development process with the best tooling in class and focus on the business value of your app!
