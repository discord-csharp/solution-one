## GraphQL with Blazor

Blazor WASM is a C# Single Page Application (SPA) alternative to the numerous JavaScript frameworks; but, what about an alternative to the popular Apollo Client for GraphQL?
This is where Strawberry Shake comes to the rescue, in this demo we'll be utilizing the Strawberry Shake CLI to generate a GraphQL Client from nothing but the schema and our queries, then integrating that with Blazor to interact with an API.
We'll be specifically interating with a few GraphQL queries, a mutation, as well as a subscription for real-time events.
